# Binary-Search-Algorithm
A binary search is an algorithm to find a particular element in the list.
Compare x with the middle element if the element is equal to x, we return the mid index.
Compare x with the middle element if the element is greater than x, then x can only lie in left half of the array, eliminate the right half of array and we apply the same algorithm for left half.
Compare x with the middle elemnet if the element is less than x, then x can only lie in right half of the array, eliminate the left half of array and we apply the same algorithm for right half.
